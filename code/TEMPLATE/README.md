# TEMPLATE benchmarks
#### boilerplate disclaimer :)
__As for other benchmarks, we are deliberately avoiding *"(pre-)processing"* steps, instead focussing on statistic analyses typical for this datatype. We do not endorse any of the methods used as *"standards"* or *"recommended"*, in fact, because we aim to start simple and avoid as far as possible non-essential packages, methods may very much not recommended. Future updates will implement more advanced methods, i.e. code and datasets are simply intended to represent good, ecologically viable tests of performance. Suggestions for datasets or methods are welcome.__

New benchmarks can be added using this template. simply add your code blocks and put the finished scipt in the appropriate group directory and you're done!
